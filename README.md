# Terragon.de Image Classifier (TIC-Torch)
with a PyTorch Convolutional Neural Network

# Why TIC-Torch?
The TIC-Torch workflow offers a convenient, fast and effective workflow to create, train and deploy individual and versatile image classifiers.

# What's the workflow?
Collect many jpg files of the objects you want to classify and arrange them in the "raw" directory. Create one subfolder for each object you want to classify and put the images inside. Example:
raw/flowers
raw/houses
raw/sea
Run TIC-Torch to resize and create variations of the images to train the Neural Network.
Run TIC-Torch to classify a new jpg.
